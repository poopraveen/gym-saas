# Pitch PDF background image

To use a **world-class background image** on every page of the pitch PDF:

1. Add an image file in this folder (`src/platform/assets/`) with one of these names:
   - `pitch-bg.jpg`
   - `pitch-bg.png`
   - `pitch-bg.jpeg`

2. Recommended: use a high-resolution image (e.g. 1191 x 1684 px or larger for A4 at 150 DPI). It will be scaled to fit the full page (595 x 842 pt).

3. For best readability of text, use a **subtle** image (e.g. soft gradient, light texture, or fitness/gym imagery with low contrast). Avoid busy or dark images that make body text hard to read.

4. Regenerate the pitch PDF from Platform Admin after adding or changing the file.

If no background image is present, the PDF uses a light grey gradient (slate-50 to slate-100) by default.
